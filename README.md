# ubirch#1 project template

Example project that just blinks the LED. It depends on the [ubirch toolchain](https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-meta).
The default code uses the [ubirch#1 r0.2 board](https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-board-firmware/tree/master/board/ubirch1r02).
If you want to use a different board, add `-DBOARD=...` to the `cmake` command line below.

## Preparation

Have the [ubirch toolchain](https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-meta) ready:

```
git clone git@github.com:ubirch/ubirch-meta.git
cd ubirch-meta
./build.sh -a
```

## Build example project

Either [download this template](https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-project-template/repository/archive.zip?ref=master) or
check out using git: `git clone git@github.com:ubirch/ubirch-project-template.git`. Then build using the following commands:
```
cd ubirch-template
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<ubirch-meta-dir>/ubirch-arm-toolchain/cmake/ubirch-arm-gcc-toolchain.cmake
make
make ubirch-template-gdb
```

## Configuration

This template also contains code to create a `config.h` file from a template (`config.h.template`). The
idea is to have an example template that creates the config header which may contain sensitive information.
In our case, we store APN and username/password info in `config.h` which is protected from being committed to
the repository in [.gitignore](.gitignore).
